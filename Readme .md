Air Carriers Market Share Prediction 

To tackle the business problem of market share prediction through supervised regression analysis. Accurate market share predictions are crucial for businesses and industries as they try to gain a competitive advantage (for example, resource optimization) and make data-driven decisions. By developing a predictive machine learning model, we aim to support business organizations with actionable insights, to help them sharpen their market presence and stay on top of their industries.
For this project, I have focused our analysis on the T-100 Domestic Market (All Carriers) dataset, specifically covering the data from the year 2018 to August 2023. This timeframe allows us to concentrate on recent years, offering insights into the trends and dynamics of the domestic air travel market over this period.
In a fast-paced business environment, staying competitive is a constant challenge. Accurate market share predictions can provide a strategic advance for corporates, by assisting them to identify growth opportunities and assessing the impact of other important factors. By focusing on this problem, we can maximize machine learning and data advantages to help inform organizational decisions in the current marketplace.
